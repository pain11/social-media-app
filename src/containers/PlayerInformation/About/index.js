      Rahul rose through the ranks of Under-19 cricket and broke into the
      Karnataka first-class side and had a decent debut season in 2010-11. He
      was left out of the squad for the succeeding season, but he returned for
      the 2012-13 season, in which he had a prolific run of form, becoming the
      highest run-getter of the season, propelling himself into contention for
      the highest honour of them all â€“ an India Test cap. With an ideal mentor
      in Rahul Dravid, KL Rahul shares more than his first name with the Indian
      legend; the dogged resistance, the compact, airtight technique, and the
      unimpeachable focus at the crease are all common factors between the two
      batting technicians. Rahul does need to work a tad more on his nerves,
      though, after his tame dismissal on 199 in Chennai further reinforced his
      image as a timorous player. However, with age on his side, Rahul can work
      on his nerves and with an all-conditions' technique to go with it, he is
      an exciting prospect for India's long and challenging overseas season and
      he would like to reinforce his spot as a long-term option for India as a
      premier Test opener.
